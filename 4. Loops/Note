//What is Loop:
Loops means when some tasks execute multiple time repeat  or some conditional time and mention time repeat.
There are three loops in Java - i> for loop, ii> While loop, iii> do while loop.

// i> for loop:
for(int i=1;i<10;i++){  
    System.out.println('content');
}

//Describe the total for-loop schema
for is the name of the loop. 
int = type of declared variable 
i = counter variable.
i=1 = variable starts with 1.
i<10 = when i is less than 10 until then i was print.
i++ / i+1 = then i was update.
System.out.println('content')= in the foe loop after given the condition and then we can write the print Statement.

//What is Infinite Loop:
when the loop execute repeatedly but not stop, then we can say that those loops are infinite loop.
ex- for(int i=1; i++){  
    System.out.println('content');
    }

// ii> While Loop :
int i=1;
while(i<10){
    System.out.println('print content');
    i++;
}

//Describe the total while-loop schema:
int i=1 = declare the counter variable.
while = the loop which we are use.
(i<10) = in this while loop we can enter the condition.
System.out.println('print content') = after declare the the loop and then we can print the content.
i++ = update that.

// iii> Do-while loop:
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.print(i + ", ");
    i++;
} while (i <= 10);

//Describe the total Do-while loop Schema:
int i=1 = declare the counter variable.
do = declare the content which we want to print.
i++ = update.
while= declare the condition.

***** Different between While and do-while loop *****
-> In while loop at first check the condition and then print, but in do-while loop at first print the content 
and then check the condition.
